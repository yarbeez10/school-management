  - Stores original filename, file path, size, and type

### Updated Tables:
- **Submission**: Enhanced with better status tracking and file relationships

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Student Endpoints:
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload files for submission
- `POST /api/tasks/[taskId]` - Submit text-only task
- `POST /api/tasks/[taskId]/submit-files` - Submit task with files
- `GET /api/tasks/[taskId]/submission` - Get student's submission

### Teacher Endpoints:
- `GET /api/tasks/[taskId]/submission` - Get all submissions for task
- `PUT /api/tasks/[taskId]/submissions/[submissionId]/grade` - Grade submission
